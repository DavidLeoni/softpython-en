    "No that we now have an idea of what happens, we can maybe understand better the statement _Python is a high level language,_ that is, it's positioned high in the above table: when we write Python code, we are not interested in the generated  _bytecode_ or _machine code,_ we can **just focus on the program logic**. \n",
    "Besides, the Python code we write is **independent from the pc architecture**: if we have a Python interpreter installed on a computer, it will take care of converting the high-level code into the machine code of that particular architecture, which includes the operating system (Windows / Mac Os X / Linux) and processor (x86, ARM, PowerPC, etc)."

    "Everything has a price. If we want to write programs focusing only on the _high level logic_ without entering into the details of how it gets interpreted by the processor, we tyipcally need to give up on _performance._ Since Python is an _interpreted_ language has the downside of being slow. What if we really need efficiency? Luckily, Python can be extended with code written in _C language_ which typically is much more performant. Actually, even if you won't notice it, many functions of Python under the hood are directly written in the fast C language. If you really need performance (not in this book!) it might be worth writing first a prototype in Python and, once established it works, compile it into _C language_ by using [Cython compiler](http://cython.org/) and manually optimize the generated code."
