If you are a customer and you want some coffee, you look at signs and directly go toward the shelves for breakfast stuff. Image what could happen if an evil sorcerer could transform the objects already placed into other objects, like for example the coffee into bleach (let's assume that at the moment of the transmutation the _hash_ label also changes).
