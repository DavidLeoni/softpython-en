    "The multinational ToxiCorp produces electrical appliances which are designed on purpose to break after a couple of years usage.  When that happens, their components are designed so they require very special tools only the corporation possess.  Customers are then forced to go to repair workshops affiliated with the corporation, and pay extra money. Over time the corporation has developed so many special shapes for screws that now its workshops have trouble managing all needed screwdrivers, so they ask you to devise a software to tell workshops which crewdrivers they are missing. You find it questionable, but they pay well, so you accept.\n",
