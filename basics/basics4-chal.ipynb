Each person an average takes `4` _minutes_ to be examinated, you included, and obviously you choose the shortest queue. Afterwards you go to the gate, where you find two queues of `ga1` and `ga2` people, and you know that each person you included an average takes `20` _seconds_ to pass: again you choose the shortes queue. Luckily the aircraft is next to the gate so you can directly choose whether to board at the queue at the head of the aircraft  with `bo1` people or at the queue at the tail of the plane with `bo2` people.
